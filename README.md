# Data Structure & Algorithms
This repository contains some data structures and algorithms self-implemented to study how they work.\
For that reason, each of the data structures and algorithms is not fully optimized for practical usage.

You can find the list of data structures and algorithms below, and you can go to the content when you click it.\
I tried to explain each of the contents in detail, but I would appreciate it if you let me know any wrong information.
